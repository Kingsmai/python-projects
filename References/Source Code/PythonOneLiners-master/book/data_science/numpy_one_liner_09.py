## Dependencies
import numpy as np

## Data: row is customer shopping basket
## row = [course 1, course 2, ebook 1, ebook 2]
## value 1 indicates that an item was bought.
basket = np.array([[0, 1, 1, 0],
                   [0, 0, 0, 1],
                   [1, 1, 0, 0],
                   [0, 1, 1, 1],
                   [1, 1, 1, 0],
                   [0, 1, 1, 0],
                   [1, 1, 0, 1],
                   [1, 1, 1, 1]])

## One-liner
copurchases = np.sum(np.all(basket[:,2:], axis = 1)) / basket.shape[0]

## Result
print(copurchases)
'''
0.25
