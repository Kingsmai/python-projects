# Lengther (E)
# Complete the lengther function definition so that it returns the number of items for every input lst.

# Note: You don't have to call the function unless you are explicitly required to do so. Defining the function is enough. However, if you like to call your function under your function definition, that's fine too.

# Hints: You can find the number of items with len(list). So, you just need to return the output of len().
