# Function with Multiple Parameters (E)
# Implements a function that takes two strings as parameters, concatenates them, and returns the result.

# Hints: Define a function with def(s1, s2).
# Concatenating two strings is as easy as s1 + s2. The result of that concatenation should be returned.
def concat(str1, str2):
    return str1 + str2
