# Square Area (E)
# Define a function that calculates the area of a square.

# For example, if I was to call your function with foo(7) the output would be 49. If I called it with foo(3)  it would return 9, and so on. Note that you don't have to name your function foo. Give it any name you want.

# Hints: Simply return x * x where x is the function parameter.
def foo(num):
    return num * num
