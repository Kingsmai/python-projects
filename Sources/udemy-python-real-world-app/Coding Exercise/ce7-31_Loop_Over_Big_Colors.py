# Loop Over Big Colors (E)
# Loop over the colors items and print out the item in every loop only if the item is greater than 50. So, the output of your program would be:

# 98
# 54
# 54

# Hints: Write the for loop.
# Indent four spaces and write an if conditional. 
# Indent four more spaces and print the color under the if conditional.
colors = [11, 34, 98, 43, 45, 54, 54]

for color in colors:
    if(color > 50):
        print(color)
